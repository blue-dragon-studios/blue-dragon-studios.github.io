			<h2>Title of Piece1</h2>
				<p>
					One cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he
					swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy savages
					of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the Cretaceous Sea; or
					among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian brutes of the Jurassic
					times. He may even now &mdash; if I may use the phrase &mdash; be wandering on some
					plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or beside the lonely saline lakes
					of the Triassic Age. Or did he go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in
					which men are still men, but with the riddles of our own time answered and
					its wearisome problems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my
					own part, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment,
					fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man's culminating time! I
					say, for my own part. He, 1 know &mdash; for the question had been discussed
					among us long before the Time Machine was made &mdash; thought but cheerlessly
					of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing pile of civilization
					only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy its
					makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as though it
					were not so. But to me the future is still black and blank &mdash; is a vast
					ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the memory of his story. And I
					have by me, for my comfort, two strange white flowers &mdash; shrivelled now,
					and brown and flat and brittle &mdash; to witness that even when mind and
					strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the
					heart of man.

			<h2>Author1</h2>
				<p>
					The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was
					expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and twinkled, and
					his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burned brightly,
					and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver
					caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our chairs,
					being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat
					upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought
					runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in
					this way &mdash; marking the points with a lean forefinger &mdash; as we sat and
					lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and
					his fecundity.
